| -------------- | ----------- |
| `src/` | Directory containing the source files for the challenge. This is used to assist testing, not for giving to users attempting the challenge. |
| `dist/` | Directory containing the challenge files to give to users attempting the challenge. |
| `service/` | Directory containing the services for challenges that require hosting. |
| `service/{service_name}/` | Directory containing the files for the service. This folder must contain a `Dockerfile` |
| `service/compose.yml` | Docker Compose file to run the services. Useful if extra configurations in the compose file is needed for the challenge to work. This file will be added directly to the root compose file in the repo using the [`include`](https://docs.docker.com/compose/multiple-compose-files/include/) element. |
| `solution/` | Directory containing the solution files for the challenge. This is used to assist testing, not for giving to users attempting the challenge. |

```

## Service Fields

### name

- `ssh`     : An ssh service, must have a port exposed
- `secret`  : A secret service, it must have a port exposed, but will not be shown in the challenge info. This is useful for challenges where the service must be discovered by the player
- `internal`: An internal service, does not need to expose a port, and will not be shown in the challenge info. This is useful for challenges where the service should not be accessed directly, i.e. web admin bots

```toml
type = "web"
```

### extras (optional)
Extra configurations for the service to be passed to the docker compose file.

!!! warning

    The configurations set here will not overwrite configurations generated by `ctf-architect`.

```toml
[[challenge.services]]
name = "service1"
path = "./service/service1"
port = 1337
type = "web"

[challenge.services.extras]
privileged = true
```

Will look similar to this in the generated docker compose file:
```yaml
networks:
  challengename-network: {}

services:
  challenge_name-service1:
    build: ./service/service1
    container_name: challenge_name-service1
    networks:
    - challengename-network
    ports:
    - 8000:1337
    privileged: true
    restart: always
```
